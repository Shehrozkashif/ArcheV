A writeback module selects either memory loaded data or ALU depending on the load data selection pin. The module has 3 input and one output of which the first input is a signed 32 bit port carrying the alu result, the second input is also a signed 32 bit port carrying memory loaded data, and the third input is a 1 bit port which is used as to indicate a load data selection. The output is a signed 32 bit port. If the load data selection port is high then assign memory loaded data to the output port, otherwise assign the alu result port.
