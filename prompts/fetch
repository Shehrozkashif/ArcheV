The Fetch module is responsible for calculating Program Counter value. There are five 1 bit inputs in which the first is used to enable instruction forwarding, the second enables the forwarding of PC value, the third indicates, forth and fifth will check that whether the br,  , jal and jalr instructions are fetched from inst memory. There are also 5 unsigned 32 bit input ports in which the first is used for Program Counter value coming from stall unit, second is used for next Program Counter value coming from stall unit, the third assigns jalr calculated pc value, the fourth is assigned the instruction coming from Stall Unit, the fifth carries pc value coming from Fetch-Decode pipeline register. There is also a signed 32 bit port which is assigned the immediate value. There are three unsigned 32 bit output ports, one for Pc value, second for resultant value of pc value added with 4, and third for next pc value. There is also an unsigned 16 bit output port which carries the address of the instruction in instruction memory. If forward instruction is enabled Pc value is transferred otherwise stall Pc value.
