The RegDA module is a pipeline register between the ALU and Decode stage. The module has 19 inputs and 13 outputs. The first unsigned 32 bit pc_in  port carrying the Program Counter value, the second opcode_in unsigned 7 bit input  port carries the Opcode, the third  dest_reg_addr_in unsigned 5 bit input port carries the destination register address, funct3_in another unsigned 3 bit input port carries the funct 3 value, the two signed 32 bit input ports carries the source register 1 src_reg1_data_in and source register 2 src_reg2_data_ data,  in two unsigned 5 bits port carries source register address 1 src_reg1_addr_in and source register address 2 src_reg2_addr_in , funct7_in unsigned 7 bit port carries fun 7 value,imm_data_in signed 32 bits carries immediate input ,two unsigned 2 bits port carries operand 1 op1_in and operand  2 op2_in value, alu_mem_data_in the destination register coming from the Alu-Memory pipeline register sign 32 bits wb_data_in, the wb_data_in 32 bits signed data coming from the Write-Back,  jal_en_in 5 input is 1 bit signal for enabling  jal instruction , jalr_en_in enabling jalr instruction, forward_op1_in forward source register 1 data & forward_op2_in source register 1 data. The output ports are the same as input ports( pc_out, opcode_out, dest_reg_addr_out, funct3_out , src_reg1_data_out , src_reg2_data_out  , src_reg1_addr_out and src_reg2_addr_out , funct7_out , imm_data_out , op1_out , p2_out, jal_en_out and jalr_en_out ) output ports are the same as input ports with the suffix of out instead of in .The Inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.Mux check if forward operation is high then source register 1 initialize as a source register 1 otherwise use sequence. Mux check if forward operation 1 is high then source register initialize as a source register 2 otherwise use sequence. Mux check if forward source register 1 is low then source register data for pc initialize as a source register 1 otherwise write back data value. Mux check if forward source register 2 is low then source register data for pc initialize as a source register 2 otherwise write back data value.The Inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.
