The Fetch module is responsible for calculating Program Counter value. There are five 1 bit inputs in which the first Forward_instr is used to enable instruction forwarding, the second forward_PC enables the forwarding of PC value, the third br_en, fourth jal_en and fifth jalr_PC will check whether the branch, jump and link and jump and link reg instructions are fetched from inst memory. There are also 5 unsigned 32 bit input ports in which the first StallUnit_PC is used for Program Counter value coming from stall unit, second stallPC is used for next Program Counter value coming from stall unit, the third jalr_PC assigns jalr calculated pc value, the fourth Stallunit_inst is assigned the instruction coming from Stall Unit, the fifth RegFD_PC carries pc value coming from Fetch-Decode pipeline register. There is also a signed 32 “imm” bit port which is assigned the immediate value. There are three unsigned 32 bit output ports, pc_out for Pc value, PC4 for resultant value of pc value added with 4, and nPC_out for next pc value. There is also an unsigned 16 bit addr output port which carries the address of the instruction in instruction memory. If forward instruction is enabled Pc value is transferred otherwise stall Pc value.
