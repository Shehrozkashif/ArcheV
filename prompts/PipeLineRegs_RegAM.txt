The RegAM module is a pipeline register between the Execute and Memory stage. A RegAM module has 14 inputs and 14 outputs. First input is a signed 32 bit port carrying the alu result, second unsigned 5 bit input port carrying the destination result address and the third signed 32 bit input port carries the source register 2 data. Rest of the inputs are 1 bit signals for enabling register write, enabling data memory’s store pin, enabling the store byte instruction, enabling the store half instruction, enabling the store word instruction, enabling data memory’s load instruction, enabling load byte instruction,enabling the load half instruction,enabling the load word instruction,enabling the load btye unsign and enabling the load half unsigned instruction. The output ports are the same as input ports.The inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.
