The RegFD module is a pipeline register between the Fetch and Decode stage. The RegFD module has 3 inputs and 3 outputs. The first pc_in signed 32 bit input port carries the Program Counter value, the second instruction_in unsigned 32 bit input port carries the instruction, the third pc_4 unsigned 32 bit input port carries the Program Counter for next Program Counter value. The output ports are the same as input ports with the suffix of out instead of in .The Inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.
