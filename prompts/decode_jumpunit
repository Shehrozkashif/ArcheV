Module contain 14 input pins and 5 output pins. Inputs would be signed 32 bit for source register1 data, signed 32 bit for source register2 data, signed 32 bit for ALU, signed 32 bit for regam_alu out, signed 32 bit for write back of destination register, signed 32 bit for memory out, unsigned 3 bit for function3, unsigned 7 bit for branch id, unsigned 10 bit for i_jal_id, unsigned 7 bit for opcode, unsigned 3 bit for forward jump operand1, unsigned 3 bit for forward jump operand2, signed 32 bit for immediate instruction. Outputs would be unsigned 32 bit for jalr of PC, bool for branch enable, bool for b_enable, bool for jal enable,bool for jalr enable, bool for jalr Pc. . It checks conditions for different branch types and calculates the target address for the JALR instruction. It then assigns these control signals to output pins.
