Module  contains 5 input pins and 2 output pins. Input signal would be unsigned 5 bit for destination a, signed 32 bit for data from destination register, unsigned 5 bit for source1 register address, unsigned 5 bit for source2 register address, bool for write enable. Outputs would be signed 32 bit for data of source1 register and signed 32 bit for data of source2 register. regFile is a vector of 32 signed 32-bit registers. When write enable is high and the destination register address is not zero, the destination register data is written to the register file at the address destination register address.  If the address is zero, the data is set to zero; otherwise, it is set to the respective register value.
