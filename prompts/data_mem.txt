The data_mem_router module is an interface between the core and data memory and manages the load and store operations.The module has 17 inputs and 5 outputs. “alu_result” are signed 32 bit port carries alu result , src_reg2_data signed 32 bit signal carries source register 2 data, mem-data signed 32 bit  input  port carries the memory data input’s value, and the rest of the inputs are 1 bit enabling load_enable load and store_enable store instruction , store_signed_byte enabling store signed byte instruction, store_unsigned_byte enabling store unsigned byte instruction, load_signed_byte enabling load sign byte instruction, load_unsigned_byte enabling load unsigned byte instruction, store_signed_halfword enabling store signed halfword instruction, enabling store store_unsigned_halfword unsigned halfword instruction, load_signed_halfword enabling load sign halfword instruction, load_unsigned_halfword enabling load unsigned halfword instruction,  store_signed_word enabling store signed word instruction, store_unsigned_word enabling store unsigned word instruction, load_signed_word enabling load sign word instruction, load_unsigned_word enabling load unsigned word instruction. “mem_data_out” are signed 32 bit carries memory data output, “src_reg2_out” signed 32 bit signal carry source register data, unsigned 16 bits address port carries address and rest of the 2 output signal are 1 bit store_signal for enabling store instruction and load_signal enabling load instruction .Initializing the source register 2 as a vector, all elements are set to zero. When the store byte enable pin is high, the byte at the lower 8 bits of source register 2 is written to source register 2. When the store high word enable pin is high, the lower 16 bits of source register 2 is written to source register 2. When the store word enable pin is high the entire 32-bit source register is split into four bytes and stored in the source register 2. When load half word enable is high, the lowest 16 bits from memory data are sign-extended to produce a signed 32-bit value .When load word enable is high, the entire 32-bit value from memory data is used as a signed value .When load byte unsigned is high, the lowest 8 bits of memory data are used as an unsigned value.
