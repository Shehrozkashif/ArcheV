The RegAM module is a pipeline register between the Execute and Memory stage. A RegAM module has 14 inputs and 14 outputs. First input is alu_in a signed 32 bit port carrying the alu result, second is rd_addr_in unsigned 5 bit input port carrying the destination result address and the third is rs2_data_in signed 32 bit input port carries the source register 2 data. Rest of the inputs are 1 bit signals for enabling wr_en_in, str_en_in enabling data memory’s store pin, sb_en_in enabling the store byte instruction, sh_en_in enabling the store half instruction, sw_en_in enabling the store word instruction, load_en_in enabling data memory’s load instruction, load_en_in enabling load byte instruction, lb_en_in enabling the load half instruction, lh_en_in enabling the load word instruction, lw_en_in enabling the load btye unsign and lbu_en_in enabling the load half unsigned instruction lhu_en_in . The output ports are the same as input ports with the suffix of out instead of in.The inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.
