A  write_back  module  selects either memory loaded data or ALU depending on the load data selection pin. The module has 3 input and one output of which the first is alu_result a signed 32 bit port carrying the alu result , the second is mem_data which is also a signed 32 bit port carrying memory loaded data , and the third  is load_data_sel a 1 bit port which is used as to indicate a load data selection. The output wb_data is a signed 32 bit port . If the load data selection port is high then assign memory loaded data to the output port, otherwise assign the alu result port.
