Module contains 7 input pins and 6 output pins. Input would be unsigned 32 bit for forwarding instruction,  unsigned 5 bits for destination address in decode execute pipelined register,  unsigned 32 bit for Pc instruction,  unsigned 32 bit for stall in PC,  unsigned 5 bit for source register1 address,  unsigned 5 bit for source register2 address, bool for  load enable. Outputs would be  unsigned 32 bit for Instruction,  unsigned 32 bit for Pc instruction out,  unsigned 32 bit for stalled output of pc, 1 bit for enabling forwarding of  instruction, 1 bit for forwarding Pc value, 1 bit for enabling stall for control unit. A load hazard indicates that the load enable pin is high and there is either source register1 value coming from decode execute pipelined register is equal to source register1 address or source register2 value coming from decode execute pipelined register is equal to source register2 address. A multiplexor checks the condition of load hazard and sets the signals to high if loadHazard is true, otherwise to low. Each output signal connects with its corresponding input register and assigns the input register value to the output signal.
