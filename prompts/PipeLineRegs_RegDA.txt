The RegDA module is a pipeline register between the ALU and Decode stage. The module has 19 inputs and 13 outputs. The first unsigned 32 bit input  port carrying the Program Counter value, the second unsigned 7 bit input  port carries the Opcode, the third unsigned 5 bit input port carries the destination register address, another unsigned 3 bit input port carries the funct 3 value, the two signed 32 bit input ports carries the source register 1 and source register 2 data, two unsigned 5 bits port carries source register address 1 and source register address 2,unsigned 7 bit port carries fun 7 value, signed 32 bits carries immediate input ,two unsigned 2 bits port carries operand 1 and operand  2 value, the destination register coming from the Alu-Memory pipeline register sign 32 bits, the  32 bits signed data coming from the Write-Back, 5 input is 1 bit signal for enabling  jal instruction , enabling jalr instruction, forward source register 1 data & source register 1 data. The output ports are the same as input ports( Program Counter, Opcode, destination register address,funct3, source register 1 data, source register 2 data,source register 1 address and source register 2 address, fun7, immediate data, stall control ,enable pins for jal and jalr).The Inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.Mux check if forward operation is high then source register 1 initialize as a source register 1 otherwise use sequence. Mux check if forward operation 1 is high then source register initialize as a source register 2 otherwise use sequence. Mux check if forward source register 1 is low then source register data for pc initialize as a source register 1 otherwise write back data value. Mux check if forward source register 2 is low then source register data for pc initialize as a source register 2 otherwise write back data value.The Inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.
