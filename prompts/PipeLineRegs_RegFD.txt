The RegFD module is a pipeline register between the Fetch and Decode stage. The RegFD module has 3 inputs and 3 outputs. The first signed 32 bit input port carries the Program Counter value, the second unsigned 32 bit input port carries the instruction, the third unsigned 32 bit input port carries the Program Counter for next Program Counter value. The output ports are the same as input ports.The Inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.
