The RegMW module is a pipeline register between the Memory and Write back stage.The module has 5 inputs and 5 outputs. First alu_data_in signed 32 bit port carries alu data , load_data_in second Unsigned 32 bit input carries loaded value from data memory ,  dest_reg_addr_in the third unsigned 5 bit port carries the destination register address and  rest of them are 1 bit signal for write enable pin write_enable_in and load enable in load_enable_in . The output ports are the same as input ports.The Inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.output ports are the same as input ports with the suffix of out instead of in
