The RegFile module is responsible for managing the read and write operations to the register file. Module contains 5 input pins and 2 output pins. dest_addr Input signal would be unsigned 5 bit for destination a, dest_data signed 32 bit for data from destination register, src1_addr unsigned 5 bit for source1 register address, src2_addr unsigned 5 bit for source2 register address,a write_enable bool for write enable. Outputs would be signed 32 bit for data of source1 register and signed 32 bit for data of source2 register. regFile is a vector of 32 signed 32-bit registers. When write enable is high and the destination register address is not zero, the destination register data is written to the register file at the address destination register address.  If the address is zero, the data is set to zero; otherwise, it is set to the respective register value.The output ports are the same as input ports with the suffix of out instead of in.
