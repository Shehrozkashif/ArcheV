The Inst_Mem_Router module is an interface between the core and data memory and is used for directly forwarding the instruction address and conditionally selecting the instruction output based on stall or jump conditions. There are  5 inputs and 2 outputs. An unsigned 16 bit addrIn input  port carries instruction address, two 1 bit input ports jumpStallEn and stallEn (one indicates that there is a stall due to a jump instruction, another  is  also 1 bit port for enabling a stall on instruction), and two unsigned 32 bit input ports memInstIn and stallInst (one port carrying a memory instruction value and the other stall instruction value). There are 2 output ports, addrOut and instOut  first is an unsigned 16 bit port carrying address from pc and the second is an unsigned 32 bits port carrying instruction coming from the instruction memory. The InstMemRouter simply forwards the input address to the output address port, ensuring that the correct address is used to read instructions. When a stall or jump condition is detected, it adjusts the instruction output accordingly. If no conditions are enabled, it forwards default instruction fetched from memory.
