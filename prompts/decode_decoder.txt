Module consist of 1 input and 16 output pins. Inputs would be unsigned 32 bit for Instruction. Outputs would be unsigned 7 bit for opcode,unsigned 5 bit for destination register address, unsigned 3 bit for function3, unsigned 5 bit for source register1, unsigned 5 bit for source register2, unsigned 7 bit for function7, signed 32 bit for immediate instruction, unsigned 7 bit for r_id, unsigned 7 bit for i-math_id, unsigned 32 bit for i_load_id, unsigned 10 bit for i_jalr_id, unsigned 32 bit for s_id, unsigned 32 bit for b_id, unsigned 32 bit for u_auipc_id, unsigned 32 bit for u_lui_id, unsigned 32 bit for j_id. 
In this module weâ€™ll first extracts the opcode from the instruction from 0-6 bits. Sets rd_addr to bits 11 to 7, func3 to bits 14 to 12 of the instruction, rs1_addr to bits 15-19, rs2_addr to bits 20-24, func7 to bits 25-31.
 Immediate values of type(i, s, b, u, and j) are extracted from specific bits of the instruction for different opcodes. Connects internal signals to corresponding output pins by pairing each output with the corresponding internal signal and assigning their values.
