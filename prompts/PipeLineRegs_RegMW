The RegMW module is a pipeline register between the Memory and Write back stage.The module has 5 inputs and 5 outputs. First signed 32 bit port carries alu data , second Unsigned 32 bit input carries loaded value from data memory ,the third unsigned 5 bit port carries the destination register address and rest of them are 1 bit signal for write enable pin and load enable in. The output ports are the same as input ports.The Inputs are fed into registers and the values from these registers are then connected to the corresponding output ports.
