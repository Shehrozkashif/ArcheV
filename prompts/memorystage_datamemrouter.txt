The DataMemRouter module is an interface between the core and data memory and manages the load and store operations.The module has 13 inputs and 5 outputs. Inputs are signed 32 bit port carries alu result , signed 32 bit signal carries source register 2 data, Signed 32 bit  input  port carries the memory data inputâ€™s value, and the rest of the inputs are 1 bit enabling load and store instruction , enabling store signed byte instruction, enabling store unsigned byte instruction, enabling load sign byte instruction, enabling load unsigned byte instruction, enabling store signed halfword instruction, enabling store unsigned halfword instruction, enabling load sign halfword instruction, enabling load unsigned halfword instruction, enabling store signed word instruction, enabling store unsigned word instruction, enabling load sign word instruction, enabling load unsigned word instruction.Output are signed 32 bit carries memory data output, signed 32 bit signal carry source register data, unsigned 16 bits port carries address and rest of the 2 output signal are 1 bit for enabling store instruction and enabling load instruction .Initializing the source register 2 as a vector, all elements are set to zero. When the store byte enable pin is high, the byte at the lower 8 bits of source register 2 is written to source register 2. When the store high word enable pin is high, the lower 16 bits of source register 2 is written to source register 2. When the store word enable pin is high the entire 32-bit source register is split into four bytes and stored in the source register 2. When load half word enable is high, the lowest 16 bits from memory data are sign-extended to produce a signed 32-bit value .When load word enable is high, the entire 32-bit value from memory data is used as a signed value .When load byte unsigned is high, the lowest 8 bits of memory data are used as an unsigned value.
