The alu module performs arithmetic operations.The module has 18 inputs and 1 output.There is an unsigned 32 bit port pc_in for the Program Counter value,three signed 32 bit  ports, src1_data for source register 1 data,src2_data for source register 2 data, and the imm_val for the immediate value, 14 1 bit imm_sel ports for selecting immediate operand,enabling add_en addition operation,sll_en enabling shift Left logic operation, slt_en enabling less then operation,xor_en enabling Xor operation,srl_en enabling shift right logical operation,sra_en enabling shift right arithmetic operation,or_en enabling OR operation,and_en enabling And operation,sub_en enabling Subtraction operation,jalr_en enabling Jalr instruction,jal_en enabling jal instruction, auipc_en enabling auipc operation, lui_en enabling Lui instruction.There is a single signed 32 bit result_out output port for the operation result. When the additional enable signal is high, the output  will be the result of operand1 + operand2. When the subtraction enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 - operand2. When the AND enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 & operand2. When the OR enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 | operand2. When the XOR enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 ^ operand2. When the shift Left Logical enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 << operand2(4, 0). When the shift Right Logical enable signal is high, the output  will be the result of operand1 as Unsigned Int >> operand2(4, 0). When the shift Right Arithmetic enable signal is high, the output  will be the result of operand1 >> operand2(4, 0). When the less Than enable signal is high, the output will be 1 if operand1 < operand2, otherwise 0. When the less Than unsigned enable signal is high, the output will be 1 if operand1 as unsigned Int < operand2 as unsigned Int , otherwise 0. When the Program Counter 4 enable signal is high, the output will be the result of Program Counter  + 4. When the auipc enable signal is high, the output will be the result of Program Counter  + (immediate << 12).When the lui_en signal is high, the output will be the result of immediate << 12
