The ALU module performs arithmetic operations.The module has 20 inputs and 1 output.There is an unsigned 32 bit port for the Program Counter value,three signed 32 bit  ports, one for source register 1 data,second for source register 2 data, and the last for the immediate value, 15 1 bit input ports for selecting immediate operand,enabling addition operation,enabling shift Left logic operation,enabling less then operation,enabling Xor operation,enabling shift right logical operation,enabling shift right arithmetic operation,enabling OR operation,enabling And operation,enabling Subtraction operation,enabling Jalr instruction,enabling jal instruction,enabling auipc operation,enabling Lui instruction.There is a single signed 32 bit output port for the operation result. When the additional enable signal is high, the output  will be the result of operand1 + operand2. When the subtraction enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 - operand2. When the AND enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 & operand2. When the OR enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 | operand2. When the XOR enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 ^ operand2. When the shift Left Logical enable signal is high, the output will be the result of operand1 << operand2(4, 0). When the shift Right Logical enable signal is high, the output  will be the result of operand1 as Unsigned Int >> operand2(4, 0). When the shift Right Arithmetic enable signal is high, the output  will be the result of operand1 >> operand2(4, 0). When the less Than enable signal is high, the output will be 1 if operand1 < operand2, otherwise 0. When the less Than unsigned enable signal is high, the output will be 1 if operand1 as unsigned Int < operand2 as unsigned Int , otherwise 0. When the Program Counter 4 enable signal is high, the output will be the result of Program Counter  + 4. When the auipc enable signal is high, the output will be the result of Program Counter  + (immediate << 12).When the lui_en signal is high, the output will be the result of immediate << 12
